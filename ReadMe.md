>_PLEASE NOTE that the project is still in early phase and structural changes are possible. Documentation will be extended._

In the past, for many times I was in the situation where I needed to create or maintain the project that just executes different commands/jobs as a part of the bigger project. 
The purpose of those commands/jobs is broad. For example, scheduled jobs that just copy some data, specific exports from database or multiple databases, basically anything that can be executed automatically without too many user interaction.

Overal inspiration comes from my desire to have a project where I can just define a new job using some convention, implement the functionality and everything will automatically become available for execution (either using CLI or Web).
